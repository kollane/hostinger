## 📋 Repository Overview

This is a **DevOps training lab repository** for learning hands-on infrastructure management. The focus is on DevOps/infrastructure, NOT application development.

**Primary language:** Estonian (eesti keel)
**Target audience:** DevOps administrators learning containerization, orchestration, CI/CD, and monitoring

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The repository contains a **progressive 6-lab series** that builds upon itself:

```
apps/ (pre-built applications)
  └── Used as subjects for containerization in all labs

Lab 1 (Docker) → builds images
  ↓
Lab 2 (Docker Compose) → uses Lab 1 images
  ↓
Lab 3 (Kubernetes Basics) → deploys Lab 1 images to K8s
  ↓
Lab 4 (Kubernetes Advanced) → enhances Lab 3 deployments
  ↓
Lab 5 (CI/CD) → automates Labs 1-4
  ↓
Lab 6 (Monitoring) → monitors Labs 1-5
```

### Pre-built Applications (apps/)

Three microservices that serve as training subjects:

1. **User Service** (backend-nodejs/)
   - Node.js 18 + Express + PostgreSQL
   - Port 3000
   - JWT auth + RBAC (user/admin roles)
   - Full CRUD with pagination, search, filtering
   - Endpoints: `/api/auth/*`, `/api/users/*`, `/health`

2. **Product Service** (backend-java-spring/) - placeholder for future
   - Java 17 + Spring Boot 3
   - Port 8081

3. **Frontend** (frontend/)
   - HTML5 + CSS3 + Vanilla JavaScript
   - Port 8080
   - Connects to User/Product services

---

## 🚀 Running Applications

### User Service (Node.js)

```bash
cd apps/backend-nodejs

# Setup
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with DB credentials and JWT_SECRET

# Database setup
sudo -u postgres psql -f database-setup.sql

# Run
npm start  # Listens on port 3000
```

**Environment variables required:**
- `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`
- `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`
- `PORT`, `NODE_ENV`

### Testing User Service

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Register user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@example.com","password":"test123"}'

# Login (get JWT token)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123"}'

# Use token
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## 📚 Lab Structure

Each lab follows this pattern:

```
XX-labname-lab/
├── README.md              # Lab overview, objectives, structure
├── exercises/             # Step-by-step exercises (5 exercises per lab)
│   ├── 01-topic1.md
│   ├── 02-topic2.md
│   └── ...
└── solutions/             # Reference solutions
    └── README.md
```

## 📝 Creating New Lab Content

### When creating exercises:

1. **Language:** Write in Estonian
2. **Structure:** Use consistent markdown format:
   - Title + duration + objective
   - Overview
   - Learning objectives (✅ checkboxes)
   - Steps (numbered with code blocks)
   - Validation checklist
   - Learned concepts
   - Next steps link

3. **Tone:** Educational, hands-on, practical
4. **Code examples:** Always provide working examples
5. **Duration:** Each exercise should be 45-60 minutes

### When creating solutions:

1. Place in `solutions/` directory
2. Include README.md explaining usage
3. Provide both basic and optimized versions where applicable
4. Add comments explaining key concepts

---

## 🎯 Key Principles

1. **DevOps Focus:** These are infrastructure labs, not application development tutorials
2. **Progressive Learning:** Each lab builds on previous ones
3. **Hands-on Practice:** Learners should type commands, not copy-paste
4. **Real-world Scenarios:** Use production-like setups (RBAC, health checks, multi-stage builds)
5. **Estonian Language:** All content must be in Estonian with English technical terms in parentheses

## 💡 When Working on This Repository

1. **Read 00-LAB-RAAMISTIK.md first** - it's the master plan
2. **Maintain consistency** - follow existing exercise structure
3. **Test everything** - all commands must work
4. **Think progressive** - each lab builds on previous
5. **Write in Estonian** - with English technical terms when needed
6. **Focus on DevOps** - not application development
